## zara e-commerce website.

* The idea was to build an e-commerce website using HTML and CSS, what was provided were mock-ups
(these are images to be used) for the website to be built. The website was pretty much in a photo-shop format, 
so I was to bring it to live from just a photo to a web-page.

+ Am glad I was able, you can find the link to the photo-shop image here https://www.behance.net/gallery/69905629/Ecommerce-Design-UI
+ While it appears there are two photo shop images, the one I worked on was the Web Platform.
